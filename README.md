This is a script that came about to fullfil a very simple need: provide an easy way for a user to resize an image.

I am not the original author of this code. It was provided by someone else who received help from many other people. I have taken the code and will be modifying it to my needs and wanted to make it available for others to do the same. This was also the request of the person who provided it to me.
